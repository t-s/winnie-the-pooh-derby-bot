Rough, proof of concept version of a bot that plays a challenging Flash game.

Adjust parameters to account for different pitchers - suggested parameters are in the source code.

Must be used with http://www.y8.com/games/winnie_the_poohs_home_run_derby.

Also, looks for and uses secondary monitor. For single monitor arrangements, change devices[1] to devices[0].

When first run, click once in the upper left of the Flash window. This helps the bot determine where exactly to look for the visual cues it uses to determine what to do.
